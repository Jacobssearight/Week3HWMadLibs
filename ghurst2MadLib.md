# Week3HWMadLibs
There once was a <squirrel> named Alexandra. She was the tiniest <squirrel> in the tree. She had always wanted to become a <flying squirrel>. 
Alexandra dreamed of having the largest, most colorful <pelt> and hoped to <soar> above fields of flowers. She told the <sky> of her 
dreams however, no one believed in her. All of the other <squirrels> were twice her size and thought she would only become a tiny 
<rat>. But Alexandra didn’t let what they thought get to her.

She ate only the freshest and greenest leaves while the others laughed at her. And when graduation came and Alexandra <resiliently> emerged 
from her <snout>; her dream had come true. The others were astonished. She had the largest and most colorful <pelt> of all the <squirrels>. 
Her <wing flaps> were like a bird’s. She had become a queen.
